# cat-feeder
Tessel project to feed my cat.

I want to use a cereal dispenser to feed my cat. I need it to turn the servo and feed her every X time, and then send up a log to a webservice so that I know she has been fed.

I also want to poll the webservice at regular intervals, and if it's been too long, I need to be texted so I know my cat feeding machine isn't working as it's meant to and I have to go fix it.
